Known Bugs or Issues
There are no known bugs or issues. I checked and I was passing all of my tests and the report showed 100% code coverage with no issues.

Experience
This was a fun asssignement. I was worried at first since it had been a little while since I had programmed in C, but it ended up being fine! I found that the main questions I ended up asking chat where just reminders about how to set up structs and syntactical questions. Once I completed a couple functions I found my rhythm and was able to complete most of them with little trouble. I did have to back and debug some of my functions beacause I was adding a lot of null checks where I didnt need them. For the most part this was a good project in remembering C.
